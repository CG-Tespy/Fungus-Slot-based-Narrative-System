# Fungus-Slot-based-Narrative-System
A replacement for Fungus' built-in Narrative Log system that is more extendable and easy to work with. The repo hosts mainly a project bundled with Fungus as a template to help understand the system.<br/>

This was made with Fungus 3.10.0 in Unity 2018. It should work well for Unity 2017 and later, with Fungus 3.10.0 and later.<br/><br/>
